# fictional-potato

fictional-potato is a client for mpd that adds functionality. This is intended to be done via the mpd channel interface (but not yet implemented).

Thanks to GitHub for the nice name proposal.

## Supported features

* sleepTimer - lets mpd fade out and stop the playback after a specified amount of time
